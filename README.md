### Project Overview
This project is a data dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to track and visualize the performance of sales agents. It provides a detailed analysis of KPIs such as the number of calls made, deals closed, call drop rates, and total sales value over time. The dashboard is designed to help sales managers evaluate the productivity of each agent, understand trends in sales activities, and identify areas for improvement.
### Objectives
The main objective of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that provides actionable insights into the performance of sales agents. The goal is to:
- Track key performance metrics of sales agents.
- Visualize trends in the number of calls, deals closed, and total sales over time.
- Identify patterns and correlations that can inform decision-making and optimize sales strategies.
- Highlight areas where individual agents excel and where they may need further training or support.
### Process
1. Data Collection:
- The dataset includes monthly performance metrics for 25 sales agents, such as total calls, deals closed, calls reached, and deal values for each month of the year.
2. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates.
- Missing or incorrect values were addressed, and irrelevant data was removed to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
### Dashboard Creation
Using Excel, a series of visualizations were created, including:
- Bar charts to track total calls, deals closed, and total sales over time.
- Line graphs to highlight monthly sales trends.
- Heat maps and KPIs for individual agent performance.
- A call drop rate percentage chart to evaluate call efficiency.
### Data Analysis
Key insights were drawn from the data to assess agent performance, call engagement, and the overall success rate in closing deals.
### Interactivity
The dashboard allows users to filter and explore different agents' performance, enabling deeper insights into specific periods or agents.
### Tool
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, validation, PivotTables and visualization.
### Key Insights
1. Agent Performance:
- Mimi stands out as one of the highest performers with 453 calls and 84 deals closed, bringing in a total deal value of $50,524.
- On the other hand, agents like Will and Josh have significantly lower performance metrics, which may indicate potential areas for improvement.
2. Call Drop Rates:
- There are slight fluctuations in the call drop rate percentage, with the highest drop rate in March (around 5.1%) and the lowest in October (around 4.8%). This could suggest seasonal or operational factors affecting agent engagement.
3. Monthly Sales Trends:
- Total sales peaked in the months of March and September, which could indicate more successful campaigns or better overall performance during these periods.
- Sales were generally stable, but with slight dips in the summer months (June, July, August), which may need further investigation.
4. Call Efficiency:
- The "Sum of Average Number of Calls Made Per Deal Closed" graph shows an efficient use of time by agents who made fewer calls to close more deals, particularly in the months of March and April.
5. Areas for Improvement:
- Agents with lower numbers of calls and deals closed may require additional support, training, or resources to improve their productivity.
- Optimizing the call process to reduce drop rates and enhance the number of closed deals per call could improve overall performance.
